          <p class="intro">Welcome to my personal Portfolio! I have recently taken the leap into Front-End Web Development. I have begun expanding my skills through <a href="https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/">Treehouse's TechDegree</a> programme, with the hope on completion to expand beyond Front End Development into more advanced JavaScript and Python skills. I enjoy the challenge of coding, and really like the combination of technical skill and an eye for design.</p>

            <h3>Personal Summary</h3>
            <p>Having spent time living in different countries and under different conditions, I am someone that is deeply committed to making a difference in the world. This translates into a desire for self-fulfillment through work that is meaningful, and in an environment where my contribution is valued.</p>
            <p>As a self-motivated, responsible and well-educated individual I bring solutions. My numerous skills and a quick learning ability make me valuable in any dynamic work environment, and my systematic nature makes me meticulous and detail-orientated. As a competitive sportswoman I enjoy an element of risk-taking and love mastering new skills.</p>
            <p>I thrive within a caring team environment and enjoy leading a team, where I bring both the systems and processes, and the human, empathy component into play. Some of the innate skills I can bring to the table are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clarity under pressure</li>
              <li>Communication</li>
              <li>Lateral thinking</li>
